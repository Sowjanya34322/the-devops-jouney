#My Understanding of Cloud
Cloud is a readily available state of resources(whether its just server(hardware),  with few clicks.
When we think of Hassle free environmnet, like we need not to consider the future capacity enhancement of the Infrastructure, We need not to worry about the scalability(up/down) and maintain 
extra resources when in Peak/off peak usage time of the product.
